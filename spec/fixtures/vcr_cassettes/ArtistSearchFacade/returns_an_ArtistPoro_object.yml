        of Fame by singer John Legend on Monday, March 14, 2011. He was variously
        known as Mac Rebennack, Dr. John Creaux, Dr. John, the Night Tripper.\n\nDr.
        John began making his own idiosyncratic music in the 1960s. Along with Professor
        Longhair, Dr. John is heir to the rich New Orleans tradition. He is perhaps
        best known for \"Right Place, Wrong Time\", an international hit in 1973,
        reissued and used on soundtracks many times since.\n\nBorn in New Orleans,
        Louisiana, his professional musical career began as a session musician in
        New Orleans in the 1950s. Early on he also played guitar and was often known
        as Mac Rebennack. He switched to the bass (\"the lowest time of my life\"),
        and then the piano after his index finger was nearly shot off protecting his
        bandmate and longtime friend Ronnie Barron. He gained fame beginning in the
        late 1960s and early 1970s, with music that combined New Orleans-style rhythm
        and blues with psychedelic rock and stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious
        ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. For a time he was
        billed as Doctor John, The Night Tripper. The name \"Dr. John\" came from
        a legendary Louisiana voodoo practitioner from the start of the 19th century.\n\nDr.
        John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits'' \"Luv dat chicken...\"
        jingle, as well as the theme song (\"My Opinionation\") for the early-1990s
        television sitcom Blossom. His movie credits include Martin Scorsese''s documentary
        The Last Waltz (in which he joins The Band for a performance of his song \"Such
        a Night\") and Blues Brothers 2000 (in which he joins the fictional band The
        Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the song \"New Orleans\").  In the 2009 Disney
        film The Princess and the Frog, Dr. John sings the opening tune, \"Down in
        New Orleans\".\n\nIn January 2008 Mac Rebennack, Dr. John, was inducted into
        The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John\">Read
